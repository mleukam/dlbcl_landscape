Welcome to the computational lab notebook for our research project focused on profiling the immune microenvironment of DLBCL using gene expression data and multi-channel immunohistochemistry, then linking clusters of similar immune signatures with mutations in tumors.

The over-arching questions are:

1. Are there recurrent immune phenotypes in DLBCL?

2. What is the influence of tumor gene mutations on immune phenotypes in DLBCL?

## Prepare RNAseq data for analysis

* [Download raw RNAseq counts in NCI lymphoma dataset from GDC](gdc_download.html)
* Pseudoalign and count Duke RNAseq sequence data (source code for cluster-based processing in `/code/`)
* Data cleaning and pre-processing

## Gene set variation analysis

* [Preprocessing counts](preprocessing_count_data.html)
* [GSVA](enrichment.html)
* [Clustering GSVA results](clustering_enrichment_scores.html)
