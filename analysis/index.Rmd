Welcome to the computational lab notebook for our research project focused on profiling the immune microenvironment of DLBCL using gene expression data and multi-channel immunohistochemistry, then linking clusters of similar immune signatures with mutations in tumors.

The over-arching questions are:

1. Are there recurrent immune phenotypes in DLBCL?

2. What is the influence of tumor gene mutations on immune phenotypes in DLBCL?

The primary data sources are:

1. Duke dataset from Reddy et al

2. NCI dataset from Schmitz et al

## Aim 1: Identify Recurrent Immune Phenotypes using RNAseq Data

### Prepare RNAseq data for analysis

* [Download raw RNAseq counts in NCI lymphoma dataset from GDC](gdc_download.html)
* [Preprocessing NCI counts](preprocessing_count_data.html)
* Pseudoalign and count Duke RNAseq sequence data
  * Run on Gardner HPC cluster
  * Source code in `/code/`)
* [Preprocessing Duke counts](dukedata.html)
* [Expanded phenotype data for Duke and NCI datasets](ext_pheno.html)
* [Batch correction and merge datasets](merge.html)

### Gene set variation analysis

#### First try at gene list collection:

Gene lists selected from work-in-progress analyis of TCGA macrophage signatures and from immune-related C2 "curated" gene sets from MSigDB. Also included T-cell inflamed signature from prior publications (Riyue Bao). No additional filtering was done after selection of candidate gene lists.

* [GSVA](enrichment.html)
* [Clustering GSVA results](clustering_enrichment_scores.html)

#### Gene set collection refinement:

* [New gene set collection](newgs.html)

## Aim 2: Link Immune Phenotype Clusters to Oncogenes

### Mutation calls

## Aim 3: Visualize the Immune Phenotype with Multi-Channel IHC

## Sub-aims:

#### Sub-aim 1: PD-L1 amplified cohort

#### Sub-aim 2: Additional gene signatures: cytolytic and double hit
